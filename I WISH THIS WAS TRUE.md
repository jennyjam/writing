                                                           I WISH THIS WAS TRUE



​	I wish there was such thing called a pencil house where there is black stained glass where the led is supposed to be. There is a door in the eraser and when you open it it brings you to a painting area where you can draw and paint. 

​	I wish there was such thing called a mat slide.  you  can draw a slide and a machine makes is with a mat.  Then you get a tube a ride it down to the bottom of the pool.  There are other machines that store the tubes.

​	I wish there was such thing call a hover board that actually hovers above the ground.  It can be programed to go any where so that you don't need a map.  It can also actually fly high above the ground.      

​	I wish there was a water ride where you have a chair, you sit and this big machine spins you. Then it throws you in to a wide pool.  There is floating belt in the pool strapped in to place.  It also has rails on it.  There is controls on one arm of your chair so that you can also steer.  Then it brings you on a roller-coaster ride back to the beginning.  

​	I wish there was a drone that could move houses.  It has four legs for moving the houses and is very strong.
