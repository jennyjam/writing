# Dolphin Show

​	It was a fine day when me and my parents were at the zoo.  We were going to the dolphin show.  we walked in to the building.  I could smell the water. It did not smell good but I felt like I could stand it for a few minutes.  Then in what seemed like 10 minutes the show began with a start.  there was one little dolphin he or she could not do anything other than make bubbles.  But the baby dolphin was so cute.  once or twice it got on the floor of the building but fell right back in.  When the trainer had  told it to get on the floor of the building and put it's tail up.  It was trying hard my dad said as the trainer stepped into the pool.  The trainers said something about the baby dolphin but I could not hear what she was saying very clearly.  The dolphins plashed up and down as though they thought the trainers were in some kind of place they owned.  then the trainers got out and once again gave commands which the dolphins followed because they got fish every time they preformed a command.  Again and again the baby dolphin tried but it never succeeded in doing a command correctly.  I knew from just looking at what they were doing that this is hard work for a dolphin.

​	I felt exited we were walking to the dolphin show.  It was very sunny.  the building that the dolphins were going to preform in is dark blue.  when we walked in the first thing I knew was that the water smelled bad.  then I told my self that I could stand it for a few minutes.  so we took a seat In the fifth row on the bleachers.  why can't we sit in the front row.  I asked.  because is the splash zone my dad yelled back.  then I started to read the information they were giving about the dolphins which was on the screen.  the trainers started to get stuff ready.  they were carrying fish and stuff like that to the pool.  the dolphins began to dive every where.  they seemed to have known what was coming.  the trainers started to do hand signals in about ten minutes.  there was a little baby dolphin that look so cute.  it was working hard to follow directions but could not. It could only blow bubbles but looked so cute.
